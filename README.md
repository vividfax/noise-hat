# Noise Hat

Knitting chart generator for a hat that uses simplex noise as a stitch pattern.

## Simplex noise

Simplex noise is a clustered randomness algorithm. When translated into knits and purls it produces a stitch pattern with an organic texture.

Unlike many traditional knitting patterns, there are no section repeats. The knitting chart shows the pattern in full: every knit and every purl. The lack of repeats in the pattern does mean it requires more focus when knitting, however, the upside is that any mistakes in following the pattern are barely noticeable.
